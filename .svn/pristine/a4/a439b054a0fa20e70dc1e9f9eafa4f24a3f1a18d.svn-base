\section{Conclusions}
%
Popularity of low-overhead application container 
frameworks has enabled derivative cloud based
business models.
%
Several challenges in efficient resource management 
for nested (containers inside VMs) setups require rethink
of existing designs.
%
In this paper, we proposed \dd, a differentiated disk cache 
management framework which provides resource conservative 
memory management along with guaranteed container level
isolations.
%
\dd{}, an application container aware hypervisor cache provisioning
mechanism,
provides flexible memory management options and differentiated
memory provisioning at multiple levels.
%
%
\dd{} supports two storage backends i.e., memory and SSD and
weight configurations at two levels---per-VM and 
per-application container for adaptive provisioning.
%
Our experimental evaluation demonstrated the effectiveness of
\dd{} by improving application performance by
extending container level priorities to the hypervisor cache.
%
Selective provisioning of applications on the SSD backend
is beneficial for all applications hosted in the derivative setup.
%
While \dd{} tested simple illustrative policies, 
we believe our work can facilitate sophisticated 
usage of policies that can handle multiple levels
of priorities and multiple storage backends.
